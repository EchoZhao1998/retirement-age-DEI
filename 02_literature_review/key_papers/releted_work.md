- women tend to get retired ealier in most situation
- The "Married" and "Poor health" two factors will make women choose retire ealier. Which make me reflect that men and women actually enter workplace at a same age level. but why women has shorter career life?

- In Finland, Riekhoff and Järnefelt (2017)reported that marital status had no significant impact on men’s retirement decisions but affected women’s
retirement trajectories; in so far as divorced women were more likely to have long careers and less likely to opt for early retirement, suggesting that marital disruptions have a more profound impact on women’s retirement plans than on men’s.
- In Japan, primary female caregivers are more likely to plan to retire earlier than men. However, in the United States, Stoiko and Strough (2019) note that caregiving roles can prompt early retirement for both men and women, likely due to limited eldercare support in Liberal welfare regimes,

- women’s retirement timing may be shaped more by family responsibilities and spousal income than by health insurance coverage.

However, in the United States,
Stoiko and Strough (2019) note that caregiving roles can
prompt early retirement for both men and women, likely due
to limited eldercare support in Liberal welfare regimes, though
traditional gender norms make women more likely to withdraw
from the workforce (Dentinger & Clarkberg, 2002).
Men typically adjust their retirement timing based on their
spouses’ caregiving needs and their own capacity to provide
care. Studies from Europe and the United States, show that
men tend to retire earlier only when their wives require signif-
icant caregiving due to health issues
