> Data Source and Indicator Definition
The expected duration of working life dataset is taken from Eurostat’s lfsi_dwl_a (expected working life by age and gender). The indicator calculates the average number of years a person aged 15 is expected to remain in the labour force, based on current labour force participation and life expectancy. This source allows consistent, comparable cross-country measurement suitable for illustrating gendered career horizon differences.
