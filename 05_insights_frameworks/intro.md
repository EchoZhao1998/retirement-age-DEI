# What This Project Says About How I Think

### Author’s Intent and Analytical Lens

## Why I noticed this issue

Thanks Marcia, CEO of Women Alliance Group(女性联盟WAG) spark me to start this project.She once shared a case she considered a career milestone: the implementation of equal retirement ages for men and women within [Cummins China](https://www.cummins.com/news/2022/03/11/cummins-inc-china-area-business-organization-brings-parity-retirement-age-women-and). The policy reportedly received strong internal feedback and subsequently influenced similar practices in other organizations.

The project itself was framed as a DEI initiative aimed at promoting gender equality. However, what captured my attention was not the normative goal, but the organizational response: a rule typically treated as a fixed external constraint was actively re-examined and adapted when talent considerations became salient.

This prompted a broader question:

> What does a retirement age rule actually do to individuals, organizations, and systems—beyond its stated intent? 

Rather than treating equal retirement age as an abstract value proposition, I became interested in understanding its **mechanical consequences and incentive effects** across different stakeholders.

## Why I framed it structurally

I deliberately chose to analyze retirement age as a structural rule, not as a cultural belief or ethical position.

Many discussions around gender and retirement focus on attitudes, fairness, or individual preferences. While important, these perspectives often obscure how formal rules interact with career timelines, caregiving norms, promotion cycles, and investment horizons—producing unequal outcomes even in the absence of explicit bias.

> In this project, I therefore focus on:
  - How a rule shortens or extends expected career horizons
  - How that interacts with promotion timing and leadership accumulation
  - How different actors rationally adapt to the same constraint in different ways

> This structural framing allows the analysis to remain:
  - Comparable across contexts
  - Grounded in observable behavior
  - Relevant to decision-makers who operate within, rather than outside, policy constraints

## Why I chose business logic over advocacy

Although the topic is often discussed in normative terms, I intentionally avoided positioning this work as advocacy.

My objective is not to argue that all organizations or governments should adopt a same-age retirement policy, but to provide a verifiable, data-informed framework that helps stakeholders evaluate the trade-offs involved.

*(this part is crucial)*
> By translating retirement age into:
  - Talent return on investment
  - Leadership pipeline dynamics
  - Succession risk and institutional knowledge loss

the project speaks in a language that decision-makers already use, rather than asking them to adopt a new moral vocabulary.

This approach reflects my belief that durable DEI change is more likely when structural consequences are made explicit, rather than when values are asserted without operational clarity.

## How this connects to my long-term path

This project reflects my long-term interest in understanding how institutional rules shape outcomes across systems, particularly at the intersection of policy, organizations, and individual behavior.

More broadly, I am exploring how the value contributed by under-represented groups can be assessed in validatable and decision-relevant ways, especially in the context of demographic aging, credential inflation, and growing ESG expectations.

I am drawn to work that sits between research and practice—where analytical rigor informs strategic decision-making, and where complex social issues are examined through mechanisms rather than slogans.

In this sense, the project is not an endpoint, but a foundational case within a broader body of work.
