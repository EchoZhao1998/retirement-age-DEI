## Rational Adaptation Under Constraint
- Individual responses (“退而不休”)
Regarding the fator for the China's respondents’ views on the current retirement age policy. the most inevitable one is economic stituation.

In relation hereto, it should be noted that in China the retirement age and the pensionable age, meaning the age at which workers are entitled to claim pension benefits, are the same. 

take female cadres as an example. If they retire 5 years earlier than men at the same level, based on the assumption of no wage increase, they will earn 168,500 yuan less on average than men of the same age, education and years of service.

the survey states that  28.7 per cent of all respondents intended to continue to engage in paid work after retirement, whilst among female workers, there are 28.4 per cent who intend to do so.

In other words, in companies suffering a financial crisis, female workers wanted to retire early to get "double insurance" (a retirement benefit plus additional revenue from another job) to pursue more economic benefits. In such cases, "retirement" does not mean a real retreat from the labour market.[4]
