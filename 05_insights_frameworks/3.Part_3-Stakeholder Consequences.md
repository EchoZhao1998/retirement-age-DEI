# Stakeholder Consequences
Gender differences in retirement can vary across countries and cohorts (Curl & Townsend, 2008; Eismann et al., 2017). Welfare regime types further structure gendered retirement patterns (Madero-Cabib et al., 2023). In Conservative/Bismarckian welfare states like Germany, Austria, and France (Esping-Andersen, 1990), pension systems historically reinforced male breadwinner models through spousal pension entitlements and early retirement incentives, encouraging early exits among women with interrupted work histories (Bertogg et al., 2021; Radl, 2013; Zweimüller et al., 1996).

Conversely, Social-Democratic welfare regimes, like Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (Esping- Andersen, 1990), feature more gender-equal pension systems that provide more incentives for prolonged workforce participation for both men and women. Liberal regimes, such as the United States and the United Kingdom (Esping-Andersen, 1990), emphasize individual responsibility and market-based retirement provisions, offering flexibility but often exposing women—especially those with lower earnings or interrupted careers—to greater financial insecurity and delayed retirement (Loretto & Vickerstaff, 2015; McNamara & Williamson, 2004). Southern European regimes such as Spain, Italy, and Greece (Ferrera, 1996), and Hybrid/(Post-) Productivist/Socialist regimes like Brazil and China (Holliday, 2000), are characterized by familialism, strong caregiving norms, and fragmented formal care systems which reinforce economic dependency and reliance on spousal pensions thereby contributing to early and often involuntary retirement among women (e.g., Kong et al., 2022; Peri et al., 2015; Queiroz & Souza, 2017).

5. Individuals: Human Capital and Silent Trade-offs
  - Education gradients
  - Pension and income implications
  rooted in traditional gender roles. For instance, although women generally retire earlier than men (e.g., Dahl et al., 2003; Nicolaisen et al., 2012), this trend varies depending on factors such as marital status, caregiving responsibilities, education, and income (Axelrad & McNamara, 2018), and is more applicable to married than single women (e.g., Henkens, 1999; O’Rand & Farkas, 2002; Szinovacz et al., 2001). Among the cohort born between 1928 and 1945, women largely followed rigid retirement structures, with exits often reactive to spousal retirement or family caregiving needs, leading to early retirement (Curl & Townsend, 2008; Radl, 2013).

  Some women retired early due to caregiving-related career interruptions, while others extended employment to compensate for pension shortfalls (König, 2017; Zweimüller et al., 1996).
  
  Women born between 1956–1964 are navigating later, more individualized, and often fragmented retirement trajectories shaped by restructured, earnings-based pension systems.

  America Harris*, and Ulrike Fasbender(Work, Aging and Retirement, 2025) show that the interaction of “gender x marital status x spousal pension x work history,”  dependency constrains women’s retirement choices, often leading to earlier retirement for married women and later retirement for men.

  Lower wages, widespread part-time work for women, fragmented career paths, the "glass ceiling," the most demanding jobs for women, unequal distribution of housework... Michela Bovolenta enumerates: "So many inequalities have accumulated throughout a woman's career that women's income levels are far lower than men's."[6]

6. Enterprises: Talent ROI and Succession Risk
  - Leadership pipeline truncation
  - Investment amortization mismatch
 According to Mcknisey report on workplace in Canada and the US.Women  Overall are less likely to have sponsors—and this really matters. Employees with sponsors are promoted at nearly twice the rate of those without. Sixty-five percent of workers with a sponsor received a promotion in the last two years, compared to just 35% of those without one.4 This mirrors external research showing that sponsorship accelerates advancement—particularly for early career employees.

 and Entry-level women are around half as likely as men at their level to have multiple sponsors or a sponsor in a senior role— the kind of advocate who can most influence career advancement. This will lead them to miss out on key opportunities, like promotion. 

 Women are highly motivated—but less likely to want a promotion.
 Women and men at all levels are very committed to their jobs. But there is a notable gap in desire to advance this year: 80 percent of women want to be promoted to the next level, compared to 86 percent of men. And the gap is widest at entry and senior levels.The reasons include "Don't see a path to promotion that feels realistic(11%),Have been passed over for promotions(18%) Think more senior people are burned out or unhappy(21%)
 
 
  "High-performing companies see better results for women". and the best practices they have applied include:
- Treating gender diversity as a high organizational priority
- Having a company leader focused on fostering diversity and inclusion
- Senior leaders being held accountable for advancing diversity and inclusion
- Senior leaders communicating that disrespectful behavior is not welcome in the workplace
- Consistently using clear criteria for hiring and promotions
- Reminding evaluators about how to avoid bias before the hiring or promotion process begins
- Having established mechanisms for surfacing bias in hiring and promotions
- Tracking hiring and promotion outcomes to identify ways to make process improvements

In the workplace, many women feel less able to speak up and take risks. Although most employees feel valued at work, women outside of leadership are less comfortable asserting themselves.

Perticularly, the report highlight thatAsian women face barriers to advancing to leadership. At mid-career, Asian women receive notably less support from senior colleagues than other women at their level. And the same trend holds for day-to-day manager support: mid-level Asian women are less likely to have a manager who regularly focuses on their career advancement or provides actionable feedback.16 These factors likely have a concrete impact on their career advancement: across five years of pipeline data, Asian women are less likely than women overall to have received a promotion to the VP level.
